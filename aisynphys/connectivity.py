    This function models connectivity as a gaussian curve with respect to intersomatic 
    distance; two cells are less likely to be connected if the distance between them is
    large. Due to this relationship between distance and connectivity, simple measures
    of connection probability are sensitive to the distances at which connections are
    tested. This function returns a connection probability and CI that are adjusted
    to normalize for these distances.
    
    The returned *pmax* is also the maximum value of a gaussian connectivity
    profile that most closely matches the input data using a maximum likelihood
    estimation. In an ideal scenario we would use this to determine both
    the gaussian _amplitude_ and _sigma_ that most closely match the data. In practice,
    however, very large N is required to constrain sigma so we instead use a fixed sigma
    and focus on estimating the amplitude. Keep in mind that the corrections performed
    here rely on the assumption that connectivity falls off with distance as a gaussian
    of this fixed sigma value; use caution interpreting these results in cases where
    that assumption may be wrong (for example, for inter-laminar connectivity in cortex).

    Another practical constraint is that exact estimates and confidence intervals are 
    expensive to compute, so we use a close approximation that simply scales the 
    connectivity proportion and binomial confidence intervals using the average connection
    probability from the gaussian profile.

    aisynphys/doc/connectivity_vs_distance.ipynb.
